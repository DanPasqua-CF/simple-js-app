This application includes the following tools:
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* JS and CSS minified files

Using Bootstrap and jQuery, I was able to, with minimal CSS customization, design the page, and utilize Bootstrap classes to implement most of the application's functionality.

The user can successfully search for Pokemon; click on the Pokemon name cards; view information about the selected Pokemon; and exit the modal by clicking on the Close button, pressing the Esc button, and by clicking outside of the modal. There are also links to the original Pokemon API index, as well as my personal GitHub portfolio.
